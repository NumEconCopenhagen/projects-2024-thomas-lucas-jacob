by sgp378, zdj807 and LucasJantunen

The point of this this project is to gain the skill to stay calm under preasure when dealing with all the problems associated with GitHubs. This skill is neccesary when joining the labor market after education as working full time is associated with great deal of frustation. 

Other than that the project as given us the skills to model a Exchange Economy (Island economy) under different conditions like plotting pareto stabilities, finding market clearing prices, maximizing utility according to one agent, total utility and comparing results with different questions. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).
Remember to run ExchangeEconomy.py file first, as this file inclues all the relevant functions.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
