# Ths model project is done by Thomas (sgp378), Lucas (zdg763) and Jacob (zdj807). 

Our project is titled **Malthus Model** and is about the maltusian growth model.
Our project seeks to model the maltusian with a Cobb Douglas model, exponential population growth, income depended fertility and output pr capita. We find steady state values for labor, output and output pr capita by given parameters. We illustrate the growth path of labor and output. We also include a sliding graph where you can change the parameters of the Maltus model and see what happens to the growth path of labor and output. The sliding graph only works in Visiual Code Studios and not in GitHub

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [MalthusModel.ipynb](MalthusModel.ipynb) which uses code from [MalthusModel.py](MalthusModel.py) so remember to run that code first.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
