# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **The development in the supply balance and turning point analysis for GDP** and is about the components in the supply balance of the Danish economy, where we look at the develpoment of the individually chosen components. Other than the supply balance we look at quarterly BNP, where we will make a moving average to end up with a turning point analysis.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. NAN1 (Danmarks Statistik) 
2. NKN1 (Danmarks Statistik)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
