This repository contains  
1. A folder with our Inaugural project. 
2. A folder with our Data project. We fetch data from **source x** on **y** and show that ...
3. A folder with our Data project Model project. We model a standard Malthus Model, solving it both analytically and numerically. We also model an extended Malthus Model, with technology variable over time, which we solve numerically.
4. And a folder with our exam project.

In each folder, you will find a .py file and a .ipynb file. For all, project runs in the .ipynb file, which takes definitions from the .py file, meaning that the .py file should be run first. Other project specific requirments, can be found in each projects specific README.md file.
