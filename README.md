This repository contains  
1. A folder with our Inaugural project. 
2. A folder with our Data project. We fetch data from **DST** on **NAN1** and **NKN1** data tables containing supply balance data for Denmark over time. We examine the developement of chosen components and create a turning point analysis.
3. A folder with our Model project. We model a standard Malthus Model, solving it both analytically and numerically. We also model an extended Malthus Model, with technology variable over time, which we solve numerically.
4. And a folder with our Exam project, were we answere exam problems 1, 2 and 3.

In each folder, you will find a .py file and a .ipynb file. For all, the project runs in the .ipynb file, which takes definitions from the .py file, meaning that the .py file should be run first. Other project specific requirments, can be found in each projects specific README.md file.
